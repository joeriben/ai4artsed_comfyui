The ai4artsed comfui project is a part of the "AI4ArtsEd" research project, specifically the subproject "TPap" (general pedagogic), funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research. See https://cris.fau.de/projects/318044853/

It contains three repos that may be used together (if wanted):

- https://github.com/joeriben/ai4artsed_comfyui_nodes
- https://github.com/joeriben/ai4artsed_comfyui_workflows (nodes required)
- https://github.com/joeriben/ai4artsed_webserver (runs workflows in a simple web interface)
